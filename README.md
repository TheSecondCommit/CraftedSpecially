## Continuous Validation
Non-functional requirements define the quality of a system. They are not directly related to the behaviour of the system, but to properties such as reliability, response time and scalability.

Continuous validation is the process of continuously checking whether the system meets its non-functional requirements. This is done by running tests that measure the non-functional properties of the system. Theses tests are ran against the system under normal circumstances and under stress. The results of these tests are then compared to the non-functional requirements.
